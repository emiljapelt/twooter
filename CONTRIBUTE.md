- Which repository setup will we use?

- Which branching model will we use?
  - We will use topic-branches, such that individual features will be on their own branch. Once the feature is believed to be complete, a pull request will be opened, and reviewed by other group members. Once verified, it will be merged into master.

- Which distributed development workflow will we use?
    - Centralized workflow where the shared repository is hosted on GitHub. 

- How do we expect contributions to look like?
  - Commit messages should be written in imperative mood, and should be descriptive of the changes in the commit. Furthermore, a description should be added if the commit-message does not explain everything in the commit. When a new feature is implemented, the commit should also include at least one happy-path test for the implemented feature.

- Who is responsible for integrating/reviewing contributions?
