# Contribute

## Repository model
Mono repository. One repository for every project(s) / exercises in the course.

## Branching model
We use topic-branches, such that individual features will be on their own branch. Once the feature is believed to be complete, a pull request will be opened to main, and reviewed by other group members. Once verified, it will be merged into master.

## Distributed development workflow
Centralized workflow with shared repository hosted on GitHub. 

## What should a contribution look like?
Commit messages should be written in imperative mood, and should be descriptive of the changes in the commit. Try to adhere to [The seven rules of a great Git commit message - Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

If the subject line of 50 characters is insufficiant to describe the commit, use the commit body. Seperate subject and body with a blank line.

A new feature requires at least one happy-path test for the implemented feature to be merged to main.
